Learning Machine Learning from Scratch

The Book [<font color="red">***Machine Learning Series***</font>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1huh6F19wBMDKIHsYKGmpql6vHhkhpW0wSMnRyAU1la8/edit?usp=sharing) is mainly devided into 4 parts:

* **Computer**: Contains Python tutorials, data structures and algorithms, and commonly used libraries in machine learning.
* **Mathematics**: Basic mathematics, calculus, linear algebra, probability theory, etc.
* **Machine learning**: From theory to practice, disassemble each process, and be proficient in using mainstream machine learning libraries.
* **Frontier**: Explore the latest artificial intelligence technology, including the underlying principle implementation.

The series (Google Docs) is only available in Chinese. Readers in other languages ​​can directly read its reference links.

* [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)
* [Calculus Volume 1](https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-1)

The code strives to be easy to understand and practical. If you are interested, you can follow [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqMyNL7XHjD938WwkGUgqNg).
