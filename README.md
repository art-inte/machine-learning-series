# Machine Learning Series
Learning Machine Learning from Scratch

The Book [***Machine Learning Series***](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1huh6F19wBMDKIHsYKGmpql6vHhkhpW0wSMnRyAU1la8/edit?usp=sharing) is mainly devided into 4 parts:

* **Computer**: Contains Python tutorials, data structures and algorithms, and commonly used libraries in machine learning.
* **Mathematics**: Basic mathematics, calculus, linear algebra, statistics, probability theory, etc.
* **Machine learning**: From theory to practice, disassemble each process, and be proficient in using mainstream machine learning libraries.
* **Frontier**: Explore the latest artificial intelligence technology, including the underlying principle implementation.

The series (Google Docs) is available in Chinese, the shorter version of [***Fundamentals of Deep Learning***](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W2B8cYcR3KEWtfgwx6D-lwyogh4PBfOCTcmA8UDwMvA/edit?usp=sharing) for English, prerequesties of computer and mathematics ​​can directly read its reference links.

* [Calculus Volume 1](https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-1)
* [Introduction to Linear Algebra](https://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/ila6/indexila6.html)

The code (include video generation script) strives to be easy to understand and practical, it is placed in the directory marked with the chapter number. There are many images and animations show how machine learning works.
